Title                   : Beautiful Strange Doom Sky Pack

Other Files By Author   : Many... A Doom 2 episode -garrulo.wad-. A Doom
						  level pack -niveles.wad-. Some scattered maps
						  -hachisch.wad, desert2.wad, mrgris.wad, etc-.

Misc. Author Info       : Hmm... Spanish guy. Sorry for this bad english.

Description             : A set of ten new skies for Doom. All of them
						  1024 pixels wide, divided in four pieces.
						  
						  The WAD archive contains a small demo map (re-
						  peated ten times, each one with a different sky),
						  so you can view how the skies can be applied in
						  the game.
						  
						  There are also three folders. The named "truecolor"
						  includes the original renders (256x192, 24 bpp). In
						  "8bits-doom" you'll find the same graphics converted
						  to Doom palette. And "8bits-128px-doom" contains the
						  128 pixel tall skies that I used in the demo WAD.
						  
						  I tried to create certain variety of atmospheres. So
						  there are some earth-like skies, an "inferno" sky, a
						  moon-space one, a Mars inspired sky..., among others.
